# TShock Auto Update
> Updated and manages TShock automatically with configurable settings

# Features
- Checks for updated and automatically applies them
- Configurable auto start (if the program is added to startup)

# Issues
> This program has a major flaw to some people and servers. Because this
> program keeps your server up to date with the latest version if TShock
> released a bugged version or broken version you will get it as soon as its released
> (depending on your checking interval). So stability will take a hit however your players
> will always be able to join with minimum downtime due to version issues (again depending on your check interval).
